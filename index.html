      <strong>Mabies</strong><br><br>
      After struggling with anxiety and mental health challenges, I discovered the healing power of journaling during the COVID lockdowns. Putting pen to paper helped me work through difficult times and inspired me, a few years later, to start creating and publishing journals for others facing similar struggles.
      <br><br>
      This has been a two-year journey of growth and self-discovery, and now I’m ready to support and uplift anyone who’s dealing with mental health challenges. My hope is that these journals can help others find peace, clarity, and strength—just as they did for me.
